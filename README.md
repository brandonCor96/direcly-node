# Authentication
This App uses 'basic-auth' in a Middlelware, all the pages including the v1 Routes requires a Basic Auth, that is gonna shown as a Promt. 
    Credentials are:
    - user: 'admin'
    - password: '1234'
Note: I know Basic Auth is also used is sent in the Headers, but in this case is used to visit the page, but works if it's injected in the route. Was implemented just to show the functionality.
